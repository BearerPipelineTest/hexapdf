## PDF Corpus Benchmark

This benchmark uses the [Stressful PDF Corpus][1] to see how well HexaPDF is handling invalid PDF
files.

The tested files are currently from the [original PDF corpus][2]. A score of 100% is not achievable
on most of the corpus directories since some of the PDFs are just completely damaged.
